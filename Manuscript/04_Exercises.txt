# Small Exercises {#Exercises}

The topic of ego is very personal.
The workshop is designed so that people dont think too much. By limiting time,we hope that other things come out.

In all the exercises we give people first some personal time and then some discussion time with two partners. That way we respect both introverts and extroverts.
